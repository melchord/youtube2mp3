# YouTube to MP3

This project is a personal project which uses moviepy and pytube to convert a youtube video to an mp3 file.

## Prerequisites:

The script requires moviepy and pytube to be installed in your local state. If these libraries are not installed, then you can do the following:

```sh
pip install pytube
pip install moviepy
```

## Run the file

To run the file the following should be done:
Replace line 7 in convert.py with the proper YouTube url

```sh
python ./convert.py
```

After this is finished, there should be a file named download.mp3 which holds the proper audio file correlated to the video
